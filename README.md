# MATH425-Final_Project
Final Group Project for Math-425 Spring 2023

## Necessary imports:

### Problem 1
**networkx**

how to install with pip with dependencies:
 > pip install networkx[default]

how to install with pip without dependencies (numpy, scipy, etc):
 > pip install networkx
 
how to install with conda-forge:
 > conda install -c conda-forge networkx
  
### Problem 2
**numpy**

how to install with pip:
 > pip install numpy
  
how to install with conda-forge:
 > conda install -c conda-forge numpy
  
### Problem 3
**numpy** (refer to Problem 2 imports)

**matplotlib**

how to install with pip:
 > pip install matplotlib

how to install with conda-forge:
 > conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
 
## How to run:
Each problem can be ran seperately.

### Problem 1:
Problem 1 utilizes 2 files, FinalProject_01.py and FinalProject_01_1.py.

FinalProject_01.py contains the set-up for the problem. FinalProject_01_1.py contains the Directed Network object and Pagerank, which were the requirements for problem 1.

Only FinalProject_01_1.py needs to be ran. If unable to run FinalProject_01_1.py because of missing module "node_list", run FinalProject_01.py first then run FinalProject_01_1.py. Please note that it may take a couple seconds to run (approx. 10-20 seconds).

### Problem 2:
Problem 2 only uses the FinalProject_02.py file.

Running FinalProject_02.py will have our answers outputted to the console.

### Problem 3:
Problem 3 only uses the FinalProject_03.py file.

Running FinalProject_02.py will have our answers outputted both to the console and plots/graphs created by using matplotlib.
